## Stand-ups
Stand-ups will be performed at 12:30 each lecture day (Monday, Tuesday, Friday) over video calls or in the NSA to discuss what is being worked on and anything blocking work.

## Git Branching
* Master Branch – Release-ready builds only  
* Development Branch – Working, in development code  
* Feature Branches – Branches for specific tickets on Taiga  

_When a feature is finished, the latest changes should be merged from the development branch and a pull request should be created. This should then be peer reviewed to ensure it’s working and that no improvements can be made, before being merged into development._

## Communication
Any questions or information that concern the more than one person on the team should be posted in the Microsoft Teams channel. If the team cannot meet in person, then a video call should be performed. If anyone is also unable to join a video call, notes on the meeting should be sent.

## Sprint Review and Sprint Planning
Sprint reviews and sprint planning should be carried out every Friday to plan the work for the week ahead.

## Code
Any JavaScript should be linted with ESLint following the standard style.
